As my first app said, Hello World! 	:earth_africa:

I'm Davide, and although there's something rotten in Northern Italy, for me it's home.

Currently student in MSc Data Science and Economics @ University of Milan.
BSc Mathematical Engineering @ Polytechnical University of Milan.

Polymath by nature, always following numbers, time, creativity and discoveries.
